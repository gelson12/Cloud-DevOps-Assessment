For LocalStack, you'll run it as a service in your CI/CD environment or locally using Docker. Ensure LocalStack is started before running Terraform commands in your CI/CD pipeline. The provided configurations mock the AWS environment for development and testing purposes without incurring actual AWS costs. This setup emphasizes CI/CD best practices by separating backend and frontend workflows, enhancing modularity, and facilitating parallel development and deployment processes.

Security Group (aws_security_group): Defines a security group for the EC2 instances allowing inbound HTTP traffic. Modify the vpc_id as per your setup.
Elastic Load Balancer (aws_elb): Configures a basic HTTP load balancer listening on port 80 and forwards traffic to the attached EC2 instance(s). Health checks are defined to ensure traffic is only forwarded to healthy instances.
Variables (variables.tf): Includes additional variables like subnet_id and vpc_id, which you would need to define based on your environment or LocalStack configuration.
